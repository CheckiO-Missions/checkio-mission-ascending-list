            Well, the general idea is to iterate over the list and compare each value with next.
            If you find an item, which is not smaller then next one, then list is not ascending.

        <div class="question">
            What instrument of Python should I use to iterate over the list?

        <div class="answer">
            In this particular solution I recommend you to use while loop:
            <pre class="brush: python">
while (condition == True):
    do something
            </pre>
            But be carefull, if condition is always True, you will receive an infinite loop.
            So, inside loop you should be able to make condition False or use break command.
            For example, this code will execute 5 times:
            <pre class="brush: python">
i = 0
while i < 5:
    do something
    i = i + 1 # better use increment 'i += 1'
            </pre>
        </div>
    </div>

            I understand about while, but what should we do instead of 'do something' in this mission?

As i said in the first hint, you must compare pair of values and check
        </div>

def is_ascending(items: list[int]) -> bool:
                    
    return not items or all(items[i] < items[i+1] for i in range(len(items)-1))
            </pre>
